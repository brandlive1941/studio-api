    <h2>Documents and Links</h2>
    <p class="articleContent">Once you have all of your documents and links added, the tabs you create will allow you to compile relative information together for easy access by sponsor space visitors. This step allows you to add documents or links to your sponsor space by either linking to a file that is hosted on your company's website or uploading a file from your local or network drive. The maximum number of files and links that can be added to your sponsor space is defined by the host and displayed at the top.</p>
    <p class="articleContent"> </p>
    <p class="articleContent">This step allows you to upload the files and links (for example, your corporate website, brochures, product details, and white papers) that you want to be available in your sponsor space.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">To add your document or link:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Add New Document/Link</strong>.</li>

        <li>Enter the title of the file or link in the Title field. If you would like to use an exceptionally long title or include additional information, enter the additional text in the Description field. This title will be displayed in the list of documents and links in your sponsor space.</li>
        <li>Specify the Subject Category of the file or link, if desired. <strong>Note</strong>: Selecting a Subject Category allows you to display the document/link in your sponsor space as well as in the event’s Media Center (if available). If you would prefer not to display your documents/links in the event Media Center, select <strong>none</strong>.</li>
        <li>Choose the file/link Category. The category will be displayed in the list of documents and links in your sponsor space.</li>
