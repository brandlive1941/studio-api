    <h2>Space Front Screen</h2>
    <p class="articleContent">Space Front Screen allows you to add a static image, an animated image, or a video to your sponsor space by either linking to a file that is hosted on your company's website or by uploading a file from your local or network drive. The front screen is an event case area within the sponsor space and a video welcome is a perfect use for this video screen.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">This step allows you to add an image or short video clip to your sponsor space. The front screen is one of the first things that an attendee’s eye is drawn to before they begin exploring the rest of your space. Thus, we encourage you to make this feature as exciting as possible. Please refer to the <a href="https://presentations.akamaized.net/ProductResources/Production/HTML/SpaceBuilderGuide/FormatRequirements.html">Format &amp; Requirements</a> guide for the accepted file formats and other technical specifications.</p>
