    <h2>Marquee Messaging</h2>
    <p class="articleContent">Marquee Messaging allows you to configure a marquee message in your sponsor space. This feature is not available for the Responsive sponsor space layout.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">This step allows you to add a short scrolling message in your sponsor space as well as modify its appearance. The marquee message is typically used to add a welcome message, highlight a special product/deal/promotion, or make an important announcement.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">The recommended character count for the marquee message is 100 characters or less. The message cannot contain the following characters: &amp; (ampersand), ‘(apostrophe), or “ (quotation marks).</p>
    <p class="articleContent"><strong>Note</strong>: Since only one (1) marquee message can be added per sponsor space, two (2) shorter messages (with less than 50 characters each) can be added with spaces in between to work as two messages.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">To add a marquee message, type in the text you want to display in the Marquee Text field. By selecting Delete you will remove the text that you have entered.</p>
    <p class="articleContent"><strong>Note</strong>: This will not remove the language alternatives that you have entered for the marquee message. To remove the language alternatives you must select the icon and delete the text for each language alternative.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">To choose the font color and the background color:</p>
