    <h2><strong>Texts and Fonts</strong></h2>
    <p class="articleContent">While font choice and typography are generally a matter of design, it is important to remember that designs should be flexible enough to permit end-users to adjust them. Assuring access to the content is essential. Some of this flexibility is possible based on best coding practices such as using relative units for font size and implementing CSS, coupled with strategic implementation of semantic markup.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">Key Concepts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use real text rather than text within graphics.</li>
        <li>Select basic, simple, easily readable fonts.</li>
        <li>Use a limited number of fonts.</li>
        <li>Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the background.</li>
        <li>Avoid small font sizes.</li>
        <li>Use relative units for font size.</li>
        <li>Limit the use of font variations such as bold, italics, and ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.</li>
        <li>Do not rely only on the appearance of the font (color, shape, font variation, placement, etc.) to convey meaning.</li>
        <li>Avoid blinking or moving text.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="articleContent">Users who have low vision, reading disorders, or learning disabilities, are most affected by font and typography choices. It is best to use fonts that are typically available on the computers or mobile devices that end-users use. Maintain appropriate contrast and avoid using text that moves or blinks.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">Using real text not only helps screen reader users and those who may need to enlarge the text, but it also has other benefits, including search engine optimization.</p>
    <p class="articleContent">Selecting fonts and making decisions about typography are both complex topics. As a result, this document is only sketched highlights.</p>
