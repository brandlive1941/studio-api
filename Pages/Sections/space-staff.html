    <h2>Space Staff</h2>
    <p class="articleContent">This step allows you to add your sponsor space staffers' names, e-mail addresses, login IDs, and passwords. When the staffers log into the event, they are displayed in your sponsor space under the Space Staff tab and can interact with sponsor space visitors. It is important that you determine your sponsor space staff and ensure their availability for the sneak preview day and the live presentation day. Like an in-person presentation, having the right staff supporting your sponsor space can make all the difference in the quality of the overall experience for the presentation attendees.</p>

    <p class="articleContent"><strong>Note</strong>: The information you provide in this step will be used as the event login information.
